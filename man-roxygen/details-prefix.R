#' The new components will have names that begin with `prefix`, then
#' the name of the variable, followed by the tokens all separated by
#' `-`. The variable names are padded with zeros. For example if 
#' `prefix = "hash"`, and if `num_terms < 10`, their names will be 
#' `hash1` - `hash9`. If `num_terms = 101`, their names will be 
#' `hash001` - `hash101`.
