# textrecipes (development version)

# textrecipes 0.3.0

* stopwords package have been moved from Imports to Suggests.
* `step_ngram()` gained an argument `min_num_tokens` to be able to return multiple n-grams together. (#90)
* Adds `step_text_normalization()` to perform unicode normalization on character vectors. (#86)

# textrecipes 0.2.3

# textrecipes 0.2.2

* `step_word_embeddings()` got a argument `aggregation_default` to specify value in cases where no words matches embedding.

# textrecipes 0.2.1

# textrecipes 0.2.0

* `step_tokenize()` got an `engine` argument to specify packages other then tokenizers to tokenize.
* `spacyr` have been added as an engine to `step_tokenize()`.
* `step_lemma()` has been added to extract lemma attribute from tokenlists.
* `step_pos_filter()` has been added to allow filtering of tokens bases on their pat of speech tags.
* `step_ngram()` has been added to generate ngrams from tokenlists.
* `step_stem()` not correctly uses the options argument. (Thanks to @grayskripko for finding bug, #64)

# textrecipes 0.1.0

* `step_word2vec()` have been changed to `step_lda()` to reflect what is actually happening.
* `step_word_embeddings()` has been added. Allows for use of pre-trained word embeddings to convert token columns to vectors in a high-dimensional "meaning" space. (@jonthegeek, #20)
* text2vec have been changed from Imports to Suggests.
* textfeatures have been changed from Imports to Suggests.
* `step_tfidf()` calculations are slightly changed due to flaw in original implementation https://github.com/dselivanov/text2vec/issues/280.

# textrecipes 0.0.2

* Custom stemming function can now be used in step_stem using the custom_stemmer argument.
* `step_textfeatures()` have been added, allows for multiple numerical features to be pulled from text.
* `step_sequence_onehot()` have been added, allows for one hot encoding of sequences of fixed width.
* `step_word2vec()` have been added, calculates word2vec dimensions.
* `step_tokenmerge()` have been added, combines multiple list columns into one list-columns.
* `step_texthash()` now correctly accepts `signed` argument.
* Documentation have been improved to showcase the importance of filtering tokens before applying `step_tf()` and `step_tfidf()`.
